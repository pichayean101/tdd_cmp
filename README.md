-Zero configuration testing platform
Jest is used by Facebook to test all JavaScript code including React applications. One of Jest's philosophies is to provide an integrated "zero-configuration" experience. We observed that when engineers are provided with ready-to-use tools, they end up writing more tests, which in turn results in more stable and healthy code bases.


Built-in code coverage reports
-Easily create code coverage reports using --coverage. No additional setup or libraries needed! Jest can collect code coverage information from entire projects, including untested files.



The Jest Open Collective
Open Collective is a platform to manage groups of people transparently. Jest joins projects like Webpack, Babel, Mocha, Preact, Vue, and many more in supporting the open source community through the Open Collective platform.
