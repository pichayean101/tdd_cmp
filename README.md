# Why Jest
```
Zero configuration testing platform
Jest is used by Facebook to test all JavaScript code including React applications. One of Jest's philosophies is to provide an integrated "zero-configuration" experience. We observed that when engineers are provided with ready-to-use tools, they end up writing more tests, which in turn results in more stable and healthy code bases.

Jest has a watch mode that comes in handy for it. It doesnâ€™t only watch for files, but also provides you with some options to run only files changed or filter by file or test names. Just run the test script with the watch option
```

```
Built-in code coverage reports
-Easily create code coverage reports using --coverage. No additional setup or libraries needed! Jest can collect code coverage information from entire projects, including untested files.

The Jest Open Collective
Open Collective is a platform to manage groups of people transparently. Jest joins projects like Webpack, Babel, Mocha, Preact, Vue, and many more in supporting the open source community through the Open Collective platform.
